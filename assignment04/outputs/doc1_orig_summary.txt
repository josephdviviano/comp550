The Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. While the council accepted King Salman's wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said. He argues the US can’t afford to alienate Riyadh due to oil and Iran.
