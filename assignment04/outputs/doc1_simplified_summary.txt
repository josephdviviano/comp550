The Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. Even as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. King Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to "roll some heads to appease the U.S."
But Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi's death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role — including one of MbS's closest aides.
