Last August, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he had discouraged Trump from testifying out of concern for a “perjury trap” Mueller might set. Trump’s answers are not expected to become public any time soon. Attorneys for Donald Trump have submitted the president’s answers in writing to questions posed by special counsel Robert Mueller, multiple news outlets reported on Tuesday. It's also not clear that Mueller's team would prevail if a subpoena fight reaches the U.S. Supreme Court. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed such legislation. On Friday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he had answered Mueller’s questions “very easily”.
