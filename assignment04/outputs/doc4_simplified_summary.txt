Last August, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he had discouraged Trump from testifying out of concern for a “perjury trap” Mueller might set. Mueller could use the answers as evidence in his investigation of Trump campaign figures. Trump’s answers are not expected to become public any time soon. I’m working on it,” Trump said. On Friday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he had answered Mueller’s questions “very easily”. That would mean the questions would not touch on the firing of FBI director James Comey or Trump’s changing explanations for a June 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump tower.
